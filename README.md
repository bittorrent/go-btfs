## What is BTFS 2.0?

BitTorrent File System (BTFS) is a next-generation file sharing protocol in the BitTorrent ecosystem. Current mainstream public blockchains mostly focus on computational tasks but lack cost-effective, scalable, and high-performing file storage and sharing solutions.

These are exactly what BTFS aims to clear up. Besides, underpinned by BTTC, BTFS enables cross-chain connectivity and multi-channel payments, making itself a more convenient choice. The intgration of BTFS, BitTorrent, and the BTTC network will boost DApp developers' efficiency in serving a wider market.

* The [documentation](https://docs.btfs.io/v2.0) walks developers through BTFS 2.0 setup, usage, and API references.

## Faucet

In order to ensure the normal use of btfs 2.0 testnet, you need to apply for BTT at BTTC testnet, which is obtained [**here**](https://testfaucet.bt.io/#/).

## Install BTFS

The download and install instructions for BTFS are over at: https://docs.btfs.io/v2.0/docs/install-run-btfs20-node.

### System Requirements

BTFS can run on most Linux, macOS, and Windows systems. We recommend
running it on a machine with at least 2 GB of RAM (it’ll do fine with
only one CPU core), but it should run fine with as little as 1 GB of
RAM. On systems with less memory, it may not be completely stable.
Only support compiling from source for mac and unix-based system.

### Install Pre-Built Packages

We host pre-built binaries at https://github.com/bittorrent/go-btfs/releases/latest

#### Initialize a BTFS Daemon

to get started, enter:

    btfs cat /btfs/QmZjrLVdUpqVU6Pnc8pBnyQxVdpn9J8tfcsycP84W6N93C/readme
```

#### Start the Daemon

Start the BTFS Daemon
```
$ btfs daemon --chain-id <chainid>
```

Specify the chain for btfs to run by `--chain-id`, the chainid of the test network is `1029`, and the start command becomes: `btfs daemon --chain-id 1029`
```
$ btfs daemon --chain-id 1029

```

**Run the Daemon**

When starting the BTFS daemon for the first time, the system will create a node account and at the same time print a string of messages: cannot continue until there is sufficient (100 Suggested) BTT (for Gas) available on After seeing such a message, it is necessary to recharge the node account with BTT through an external account, and the system suggests a minimum of 100 BTT, which is used as gas to deploy a node vault contract by the node account.
After the recharge, the BTFS node will create the vault contract.

At this point, the BTFS node is up and running


### Build from Source

#### Requires
* GO
* GNU make
* Git
* GCC (or some other go compatible C Compiler) (optional)

#### Install Go
If you need to update: [Download latest version of Go](https://golang.org/dl/).

You'll need to add Go's bin directories to your `$PATH` environment variable e.g., by adding these lines to your `/etc/profile` (for a system-wide installation) or `$HOME/.profile`:

```
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
```

(If you run into trouble, see the [Go install instructions](https://golang.org/doc/install)).

Clone the go-btfs repository
```
$ git clone https://github.com/bittorrent/go-btfs
```

Navigate to the go-btfs directory and run `make install`.
```
$ cd go-btfs
$ make install
```

A successful make install outputs something like:
```
$ make install
go: downloading github.com/tron-us/go-btfs-common v0.2.28
go: extracting github.com/tron-us/go-btfs-common v0.2.28
go: finding github.com/tron-us/go-btfs-common v0.2.28
go version go1.14.1 darwin/amd64
bin/check_go_version 1.14
go install  "-asmflags=all='-trimpath='" "-gcflags=all='-trimpath='" -ldflags="-X "github.com/bittorrent/go-btfs".CurrentCommit=e4848946d" ./cmd/btfs
```
Afterwards, run `btfs init` and `btfs daemon` to initialize and start the daemon. To re-initialize a new pair of keys, you can shut down the daemon first via `btfs shutdown`. Then run `rm -r .btfs` and `btfs init` again.

### Docker

Developers also have the option to build a BTFS daemon within a Docker container. After cloning the go-btfs repository, navigate into the go-btfs directory. This is where the Dockerfile is located. Build the docker image:
```
$ cd go-btfs
$ docker image build -t btfs_docker .   // Builds the docker image and tags "btfs_docker" as the name 
```

A successful build should have an output like:
```
Sending build context to Docker daemon  2.789MB
Step 1/37 : FROM golang:1.15
 ---> 4fe257ac564c
Step 2/37 : MAINTAINER bittorrent <support@tron.network>
 ---> Using cache
 ---> 02409001f528

...

Step 37/37 : CMD ["daemon", "--migrate=true"]
 ---> Running in 3660f91dce94
Removing intermediate container 3660f91dce94
 ---> b4e1523cf264
Successfully built b4e1523cf264
Successfully tagged btfs_docker:latest
```

Start the container based on the new image. Starting the container also initializes and starts the BTFS daemon.
```
$ docker container run --publish 5001:5001 --detach --name btfs1 btfs_docker
```

The CLI flags are as such:

* `--publish` asks Docker to forward traffic incoming on the host’s port 8080, to the container’s port 5001.
* `--detach` asks Docker to run this container in the background.
* `--name` specifies a name with which you can refer to your container in subsequent commands, in this case btfs1.

Configure cross-origin(CORS)
You need to configure cross-origin (CORS) to access the container from the host.
```
(host) docker exec -it btfs1 /bin/sh // Enter the container's shell
```

Then configure cross-origin(CORS) with btfs

```
(container) btfs config --json API.HTTPHeaders.Access-Control-Allow-Origin '["http://$IP:$PORT"]'
(container) btfs config --json API.HTTPHeaders.Access-Control-Allow-Methods '["PUT", "GET", "POST"]'
```

E.g:
```
(container) btfs config --json API.HTTPHeaders.Access-Control-Allow-Origin '["http://localhost:5001"]'
(container) btfs config --json API.HTTPHeaders.Access-Control-Allow-Methods '["PUT", "GET", "POST"]'
```

Exit the container and restart the container
```
(container) exit
(host) docker restart btfs1
```

You can access the container from the host with http://localhost:5001/webui.

Execute commands within the docker container:
```
docker exec CONTAINER btfs add FILE
```

## Getting Started

### Some things to try

Basic proof of 'btfs working' locally:

    echo "hello world" > hello
    btfs add hello
    # This should output a hash string that looks something like:
    # QmaN4MmXMduZe7Y7XoMKFPuDFunvEZU6DWtBPg3L8kkAuS
    btfs cat <that hash>
