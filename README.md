## What is BTFS 4.0?

BTFS, as an innovative force in the BitTorrent ecosystem, has not only accelerated the development of distributed file sharing technology, but also taken a leading position in the field of DePIN. DePIN - which stands for Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network - encourages network participants to jointly invest resources to deploy and maintain a more stable and efficient network infrastructure through a token reward mechanism. Current mainstream public blockchains mostly focus on computational tasks but lack cost-effective, scalable, and high-performing file storage and sharing solutions.

These are exactly what BTFS aims to clear up. Additionally, underpinned by BTTC, BTFS enables cross-chain connectivity and multi-channel payments, making it a more convenient choice. The integration of BTFS, BitTorrent, and the BTTC network will boost DApp developers' efficiency in serving a wider market.

- The [documentation](https://docs.btfs.io/) walks developers through BTFS 4.0 setup, usage, and API references.

Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePINs), catalyzed by advancements in blockchain technology, aim to revolutionize network architecture by shifting away from centralized infrastructure. This transformation is made possible by the evolution of blockchain infrastructure and advancements in cryptography, enabling a global collaborative effort to establish open and permissionless infrastructure. This approach disrupts traditional infrastructure models, which are typically dominated by major corporations.
The BitTorrent File System (BTFS), an open and distributed file storage system, aligns perfectly with the goals of DePIN.

BTFS represents the next generation of decentralized file storage systems powered by blockchain technology and peer-to-peer transmission. It allows users to store files across multiple global nodes, enhancing file security and reliability while facilitating faster access and transfer. This setup provides an effortless file management and sharing experience. Additionally, it incorporates key features from the BitTorrent Chain (BTTC) network, such as cross-chain connectivity and multichannel payment options.

As a stellar player in the DePIN space, BTFS v4.0 boasts the following advantages:

- Storage Providers (SPs) as Core Infrastructure: BTFS v4.0 introduces Storage Providers (SPs) as dedicated, verified nodes responsible for secure data storage and service provision. Only BTTC validators can become SPs, ensuring high-quality storage resources and enhanced network reliability.
- Smart Contract-Based Metadata Management: File metadata is now managed through smart contracts on the BTTC network, providing transparent, auditable, and tamper-resistant metadata storage with on-chain verification.
- Decentralized Storage: BTFS has achieved global decentralized file storage through its distributed network. Unlike centralized storage on single servers, this method significantly increases data redundancy and reduces the risk of data loss. The BTFS v3.0 update includes enhancements such as symmetric encryption for secure data transmission and new features like Keystore files for managing BTFS nodes.
- Enhanced Security: The decentralized nature of data storage makes it difficult for attackers to target all nodes simultaneously, greatly improving the system's overall security.
- Censorship-Proof: The inherent nature of a decentralized storage system makes it extremely difficult for any single organization to censor or block content, ensuring the free flow of data.
- Seamless Integration Into the BitTorrent Ecosystem: The seamless integration of BTFS with the BitTorrent ecosystem allows users to freely access and share files, as well as facilitates cross-chain transactions and payments via BTTC.
- User-friendly API and Visual Interface: A newly updated BTFS website offers a user-friendly API and visual interface, featuring detailed road maps on Storage Reward halving and various other modules.
- Transparent Market Mechanism: The market mechanism within BTFS ensures complete transparency in storage and payment processes, providing users with maximum visibility into their data.
- Encryption Technology: By leveraging advanced encryption technologies, BTFS enhances data privacy and security, ensuring data integrity and preventing unauthorized access during transmission and storage.

BTFS, a leading project in the space of DePIN, is committed to advancing and enhancing the decentralized physical infrastructure network. The improved token economics of BTFS not only align with the vision of DePIN but also lay a solid foundation for the growth of decentralized networks. As technology and community evolve, BTFS is poised to play an increasingly significant role in the decentralized world.

## Faucet

In order to ensure the normal use of BTFS 4.0 testnet, you need to apply for BTT at BTTC testnet, which is obtained [**here**](https://testfaucet.bt.io/#/).

## Install BTFS

The download and install instructions for BTFS are over at: https://docs.btfs.io/docs/install-run-btfs20-node.

### System Requirements

BTFS can run on most Linux, macOS, and Windows systems. We recommend
running it on a machine with at least 2 GB of RAM (it’ll do fine with
only one CPU core), but it should run fine with as little as 1 GB of
RAM. On systems with less memory, it may not be completely stable.
Only support compiling from source for mac and unix-based system.

### Install Pre-Built Packages

We host pre-built binaries at https://github.com/bittorrent/go-btfs/releases/latest

```

#### Start the Daemon

Start the BTFS Daemon

```
$ btfs daemon --chain-id <chainid>
```

Specify the chain for btfs to run by `--chain-id`, the chainid of the test network is `1029`, and the start command becomes: `btfs daemon --chain-id 1029`

```

```

**Run the Daemon**

When starting the BTFS daemon for the first time, the system will create a node account and at the same time print a string of messages: cannot continue until there is sufficient (30000 Suggested) BTT (for Gas) available on After seeing such a message, it is necessary to recharge the node account with BTT through an external account, and the system suggests a minimum of 30000 BTT, which is used as gas to deploy a node vault contract by the node account.
After the recharge, the BTFS node will create the vault contract.

At this point, the BTFS node is up and running

### Build from Source

#### Requires

- GO
- GNU make
- Git
- GCC (or some other go compatible C Compiler) (optional)

#### Install Go

If you need to update: [Download latest version of Go](https://golang.org/dl/).

You'll need to add Go's bin directories to your `$PATH` environment variable e.g., by adding these lines to your `/etc/profile` (for a system-wide installation) or `$HOME/.profile`:

```
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
```

(If you run into trouble, see the [Go install instructions](https://golang.org/doc/install)).

Clone the go-btfs repository

```
$ git clone https://github.com/bittorrent/go-btfs
```

Navigate to the go-btfs directory and run `make install`.

```
$ cd go-btfs
$ make install
```

A successful make install outputs something like:

```
$ make install
go: downloading github.com/tron-us/go-btfs-common v0.2.28
go: extracting github.com/tron-us/go-btfs-common v0.2.28
go: finding github.com/tron-us/go-btfs-common v0.2.28
go version go1.14.1 darwin/amd64
bin/check_go_version 1.14
go install  "-asmflags=all='-trimpath='" "-gcflags=all='-trimpath='" -ldflags="-X "github.com/bittorrent/go-btfs".CurrentCommit=e4848946d" ./cmd/btfs
```

Afterwards, run `btfs init` and `btfs daemon` to initialize and start the daemon. To re-initialize a new pair of keys, you can shut down the daemon first via `btfs shutdown`. Then run `rm -r .btfs` and `btfs init` again.

### Docker

Developers also have the option to build a BTFS daemon within a Docker container. After cloning the go-btfs repository, navigate into the go-btfs directory. This is where the Dockerfile is located. Build the docker image:

```
$ cd go-btfs
$ docker image build -t btfs_docker .   // Builds the docker image and tags "btfs_docker" as the name
```

A successful build should have an output like:

```
Sending build context to Docker daemon  2.789MB
Step 1/37 : FROM golang:1.15
 ---> 4fe257ac564c
Step 2/37 : MAINTAINER bittorrent <support@tron.network>
 ---> Using cache
 ---> 02409001f528

...

Step 37/37 : CMD ["daemon", "--migrate=true"]
 ---> Running in 3660f91dce94
Removing intermediate container 3660f91dce94
 ---> b4e1523cf264
Successfully built b4e1523cf264
Successfully tagged btfs_docker:latest
```

Start the container based on the new image. Starting the container also initializes and starts the BTFS daemon.

```
$ docker container run --publish 5001:5001 --detach --name btfs1 btfs_docker
```

The CLI flags are as such:

- `--publish` asks Docker to forward traffic incoming on the host’s port 8080, to the container’s port 5001.
- `--detach` asks Docker to run this container in the background.
- `--name` specifies a name with which you can refer to your container in subsequent commands, in this case btfs1.

Configure cross-origin(CORS)
You need to configure cross-origin (CORS) to access the container from the host.

```
(host) docker exec -it btfs1 /bin/sh // Enter the container's shell
```

Then configure cross-origin(CORS) with btfs

```
(container) btfs config --json API.HTTPHeaders.Access-Control-Allow-Origin '["http://$IP:$PORT"]'
(container) btfs config --json API.HTTPHeaders.Access-Control-Allow-Methods '["PUT", "GET", "POST"]'
```

E.g:

```
(container) btfs config --json API.HTTPHeaders.Access-Control-Allow-Origin '["http://localhost:5001"]'
(container) btfs config --json API.HTTPHeaders.Access-Control-Allow-Methods '["PUT", "GET", "POST"]'
```

Exit the container and restart the container

```
(container) exit
(host) docker restart btfs1
```

You can access the container from the host with http://localhost:5001/webui.

Execute commands within the docker container:

```
docker exec CONTAINER btfs add FILE
```

### Notices

After upgrade to go-btfs v2.3.1, if you find that your node connectivity has deteriorated, you can execute the following command:

```
btfs config Swarm.ResourceMgr.Limits.System --json '{"ConnsInbound":0}'
```

Then restart your btfs node.
This command will help you unblock the inbound connections to improve connectivity and thus increase the chances of getting a contract.

## Getting Started
